"My wyf loves it! I love the way it's wrapped around my arms! I like that it's made of a very soft base that gets to the body. I love the way it wraps around my wrists, I love how it's made from a softer base that gives it a bit of a matte finish. It's soft and comfortable, it doesn't cling too much to my body and it's the best looking base I've ever gotten. It's perfect to put on my dress, my shoes or your outfit and it's perfect to put on my makeup.

"Cheap price.  Cheap quality.  Ordered two.  One didn't work at all.  The other only registered 10% to 20% of the steps taken.  I took it up to a full-time job, but was told I had to pay extra for an extra month.  But I'm not getting any money and am still getting a refund.  It's not worth the money.  I've been told to pay extra for more weeks. I just can't afford the extra time and time again. 

I bought this because I was looking for a new laptop.  I've been using this for a year now, and it's the best thing I've ever purchased.  We have a lot"
"I've used this product in the past and I remember feeling really great overall while using it, so I wanted to try it again.  I haven't been on it that long yet but within a month I can tell you that I am already noticing some positive changes to my body again.  One thing that sticks out is that my hair is a lot healthier.  I usually lose a lot of hair in the process of washing and rinsing in the shower daily, but I hardly lose any hair now.  Reminds me of when I'm pregnant.<br />Will update this again when I've been using it longer.

"If you have a sugar craving on keto this comes in handy as well as helping to balance the fat intake.

Another nice feature is that if you have any kind of low carb food that you can add to your diet, like gluten, I'd definitely recommend adding it to your diet as well.

4. Make sure to drink lots of water and get plenty of exercise.

One of the most important things that I did during my keto journey was to do a daily exercise program for my kids. My keto dieter, who is very strict about exercising, was very strict about getting enough fluids to help his body keep the ketones down. I also did a weekly plan to get him to have a regular exercise"
"I've had it for 3 weeks now and so far, so good. I like that it's sensitive; even picking it up registers a few small lbs of pressure. It does need to be put on a VERY flat surface, preferably in the same spot every time. It just keeps going. I've tried it on more than once and it can be changed. It's the only one I have not tried for some reason. I believe that it will work on other mice as well. I have a pair of other mice that I have not tried, but they feel a little less sensitive. This is the only one I've tried that I haven't tried. It works like a charm! I'll be purchasing more as I get older. I"
