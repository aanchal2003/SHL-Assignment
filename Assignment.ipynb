I love the way it wraps around my wrists, I love how it's made from a softer base that gives it a bit of a matte finish. It's soft and comfortable, it doesn't cling too much to my body and it's the best looking base I've ever gotten. It's perfect to put on my dress, my shoes or your outfit and it's perfect to put on my makeup.

I took it up to a full-time job, but was told I had to pay extra for an extra month.  But I'm not getting any money and am still getting a refund.  It's not worth the money.  I've been told to pay extra for more weeks. I just can't afford the extra time and time again. \n",

I haven't been on it that long yet but within a month I can tell you that I am already noticing some positive changes to my body again.  One thing that sticks out is that my hair is a lot healthier.  I usually lose a lot of hair in the process of washing and rinsing in the shower daily, but I hardly lose any hair now.

It does need to be put on a VERY flat surface, preferably in the same spot every time. It just keeps going. I've tried it on more than once and it can be changed. It's the only one I have not tried for some reason. I believe that it will work on other mice as well. I have a pair of other mice that I have not tried, but they feel a little less sensitive. This is the only one I've tried that I haven't tried. It works like a charm! I'll be purchasing more as I get older. I\n"
